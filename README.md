# WillItRain

An over engineered tool to deliver the weather notifications and alerts to your phone.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run the tool:

- [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) to look up the weather anywhere on the globe
- [Nexmo SMS API](https://developer.nexmo.com/) to send an SMS to your phone
- [Poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) to declare, manage and install Python dependencies

The tool incorporates third party components whose licenses, privacy policies, ad terms of services you can find at the following links:
- Dark Sky: https://darksky.net/dev/docs/terms#terms-of-service
- Nexmo: https://www.nexmo.com/terms-of-use

### Installing


#### Install git hooks

```bash
ln -s ../../pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
ln -s ../../post-merge.sh .git/hooks/post-merge
```

#### Install Python dependencies

Poetry will detect if you are inside a virtualenv ( it will create a new virtualenv if one doesn't already exist)  and install the packages accordingly. Poetry uses `pyproject.toml` to replace `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `MANIFEST.in` and `Pipfile`.

```bash
$ poetry config settings.virtualenvs.create true
$ poetry config settings.virtualenvs.in-project true
$ poetry install
```

#### Activate virtual environment

Once a virtual environment has been created, it can be “activated” using a script in the virtual environment’s binary directory.

```bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Add credentials

It’s important to keep credentials such as your Dark Sky API Secret Key  by storing them in a way that prevents unauthorized access. We store them in environment variables which are then accessed from the tool. Add your credentials to `darksky/darksky.env` and `sms/nexmo.env`. You can find their templates in their directories accordingly. Source the credentials:

```bash
source ./darksky/darksky.env
source ./sms/nexmo.env
```

#### Run the tool

```bash
$ python forecast.py --lat 40.730610 --lon -73.935242 --to <your phone number>
```

### Testing

To test the code, run:

```bash
$ ./run_test.sh
```

### Formating code

We use [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) and [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) to format the code. We check the code format when you open a PR to contirubte to the project using [`run_format_check.sh`](run_format_check.sh).

### Why?

Why not? But seriously, I always wanted to wake up and receive an SMS notification about the weather forecast for the day. I and [Feruz](https://github.com/FeruzOripov) decided to write own little and over-engineered tool for that.
